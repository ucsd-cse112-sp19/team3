# Commits
The commit format is as follows - Firstname: commit message. Very simple!

# Components
For the time being, while we are learning about components, we will be keeping them self-contained. I made a simple example in the "Main" folder. Notice how the CSS file and html file are self-contained (except for the logo). Keep things this way until otherwise mentioned!

# Styling
For the time being (maybe permanently if no one has issues with this style), here are a few guidelines I'd like to enforce on html and css code. They're mostly pretty obvious, but some are my personal preference:
1. Tab once for every indent
2. Opening and closing brackets (like \<div\> and \</div\>) should be indented the same amount
3. If you have a css class within a css class, name them accordingly. Ex: In main.html, we have main-header and within it, main-header-component. Because the component is inside main-header, we prefix it with main-header.
4. Naming convention for files: Capital letter for each word, no spaces, no special characters.
5. Naming convention for css classes: lowercase everything, separate words with hyphens.
6. Naming convention for variables and methods: camelcase, no spaces
